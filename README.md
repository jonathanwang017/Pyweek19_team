Pyweek19_team
=============
First attempt at PyWeek Python Game Programming Challenge  
The theme is one room...let's see where that takes us

Our idea is the same room on every level with a different maze in each room  
but the maze is <i>INVISIBLE</i>

There are also spike traps in this invisible maze and every time the player
dies a ghost image is left at the trap

At the start of the level is a button that reveals the maze so it becomes
a sort of memory game with ghost players as hints every time player dies

At the exit, fade screen and return player to starting location in next level


Possible Add-Ons
================
Enemies - need to decide how to implement


Audio (mchawla)
===============
music loop for game
music loop for title screen
hit wall sfx
spike trap sfx
finish level sfx


Graphics
========
player
wall
background
button
goal


Tenative Level Layout

From a design standpoint this layout is not square and it is easy to create
dead ends for the maze
